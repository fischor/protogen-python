# `protogen`

Package `protogen` makes writing `protoc` plugins easier.
Working with the raw `CodeGeneratorRequest` i.e. the raw Descriptor messages can be cumbersome.
`protogen` resolves and links the Descriptors from the CodeGeneratorRequest i.e. turns them into their corresponding `protogen` classes that are easier to work with.
It also provides mechanisms that are espacially useful to generate Python code by dealing with Python imports.

## Installation

 Package `protogen` is available via `pip`. To install run:

```
pip install protogen
```

## API

`protogen` provides a bunch of classes. Most of them are simply replacements of their corresponding descriptors. E.g. `protogen.File` represents a `FileDescriptor`, `protogen.Message` a `Descriptor`, `protogen.Field` a FieldDescriptor etc. They should be self explanatory. You can read their docstrings for more information about them.

The classes `protogen.Options`, `protogen.Plugin` and `protogen.GeneratedFile` make up a framework to generate files.
You can see these in action in the following example plugin:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""An example plugin."""

import protogen

def generate(gen: protogen.Plugin):
    for f in gen.files_to_generate:
        g = gen.new_generated_file(
            f.proto.name.replace(".proto", ".py"), 
            f.py_import_path,
        )
        g.P("# Generated code ahead.")
        g.P()
        g.print_imports()
        g.P()
        for m in f.message:
            g.P("class ", m.py_ident, ":")
            for ff in m.fields:
                # ...
        for s in f.services:
            g.P("class ", s.py_ident, ":")
            for m in f.methods:
                g.P("  def ", m.py_name, "(request):")
                g.P("    pass")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    opts = protogen.Options()
    opts.run(generate)
```

## class `protogen.Options`

The `protogen.Options` class can be used to specify options for the resolution process (resolution from plain proto descriptors to `protogen` classes).
`Option.run(f: func(Plugin))` waits for `protoc` to write the `CodeGeneratorRequest` to `stdin`, resolves the descriptors contained in it to their corresponding `protogen` classes and initialize a new `Plugin` with the resolved classes.  
`f` is then called with the `Plugin` as argument.

Once `f` returns, `Options` will collect the `CodeGeneratorResponse` from the `Plugin` that contains the all created `GeneratedFile`s and write it to `stdout` for `protoc` to pick it up.
`protoc` writes the generated files to disk.

## class `protogen.Plugin`

The `Plugin` class holds the files code generation is requested for in the `Plugin.files_to_generate` attribute. These are the files that were provided as command line arguments to `protoc`.
Any options/parameters passed to the plugin via the `protoc --plugin_opt=<param>` command line flag are accessible via `Plugin.parameter`.
With `Plugin.new_generated_file` a new `GeneratedFile` gets created that is automatically added to the `CodeGeneratorResponse` of the plugin.
Typically, but not necessarily, one file for each file in `Plugin.files_to_generate` is created.

## class `protogen.GeneratedFile`

The `GeneratedFile` is just a buffer you can add lines to using the `g.P` (print) method.
A `GeneratedFile` is created with `Plugin.new_generated_file(filename, py_import_path)`.
The `filename` is obviously the name of the file to be created.
The `py_import_path` is used for *import resolution* (see below).

## Import resolution

This assumes the Plugin generates Python code. For other kinds of Plugins, the following is not relevant.

It is often necessary to import messages and enums that are defined in different Python modules.
For example, a Protobuf Messages might reference `google.protobuf.Timestamp` in one of its fields.
The corresponding Python class `google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp` needs to be imported before its mentioned in the generated code.

For context: the `protogen.PyImportPath` class represent a Python import path. Is just a wrapper around an import path (string).
The `PyIdent` class represent a Python identifier. It holds a `PyImportPath` together with a name (e.g. class name).

There are way how one may import and reference a class in Python.
One might import `from google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2 import Timestamp` and reference it by simply `Timestamp` is the module.
However, to avoid ambiguities (here: two messages with the same name) it is often better to `import google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2` and reference it using its fully qualified Python identifier: `google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp` *in generated code*.

The `protogen.GeneratedFile` is using this approach and provides mechanism to handle imports automatically.
Internally `GeneratedFile` maintains a list of `PyImportPath`s that it needs to import (a mark where to print the imports in the output of the `GeneratedFile` can be set using `GeneratedFile.print_imports()`).
`PyImportPaths` might be added to this list implictly when calling `GeneratedFile.P(*args)` or rather explicitly when calling `GeneratedFile.qualified_py_ident(PyIdent)`.
When any of the arguments to `GeneratedFile.P` is a `protogen.PyIdent`, the `py_import_path` of the `GeneratedFile` gets compared to the arguments `PyIdent.py_import_path`. 
If they are from different Python modules, the arguments import path will be added to the list of imports and the fully qualified name of the `PyIdent` will be written to the `GeneratedFile`s buffer. 
If both files are from the same `PyImportPath`, then the path can be omitted. In that case just the simple class name (e.g. `Timestamp`) will be written to the buffer.

For example:

```python
# g is of type protogen.GeneratedFile
# message_a and message_b are of type protogen.Message

>>> g.py_import_path
{ "mypackage.mymodule" }

>>> message_a.py_ident
{ py_import_path: "google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2", py_name: "Timestamp" }
>>> g.P("hello ", message_a.py_ident) 
# adds "hello google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp" to g's buffer and "google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2" to the imports

>>> message_b.py_ident
{ py_import_path: "mypackage.mymodule", py_name: "MyMessage" }
>>> g.P("hello ", message_b.py_ident) 
# adds "hello MyMessage" to g's buffer (and nothing to the imports)
```

Note that you can provide a custom `py_import_func` in the `Options` constructor.
This function is used in the resolution process to calculate the `PyImportPath` for `protogen.File`s.
`protogen.Message`s, `protogen.Service`s and `protogen.Enum`s inherit the `PyImportPath` (that is part of their `PyIdent`) from the file they are defined in.
By default the `protogen.default_py_import_func` is used. 
It is compatible with the style of the offical Python `protoc` plugin that generates for each input file `path/to/file.proto` a corresponding `path/to/file_pb2.py` file.

For example, assume you know that code generation for proto definitions that are part of the `mypackage.**` proto package happens with a `protoc` plugin that generates one `.py` file per proto package. 
That `plugin` also omits the `_pb2` suffix.
For the proto package `mypackage.api.a`, that might contain any number of files, it creates a `mypackage/api/a.py` file.
For the proto package `mypackage.api.b`, a `mypackage/api/b.py` file.

A `py_import_func` describing this would be:

```python
def py_import_func(
    proto_filename: str, 
    proto_package:str,
) -> protogen.PyImportPath:
    if proto_package.split(".")[0] == "mypackage":
        # Python import path is simply the package name.
        return protogen.PyImportPath(proto_package) 
    # For every other package, assume its generated with the offical Python plugin.
    return protogen.default_py_import_func(proto_filename, proto_package)
```

# Misc

## What is a protoc plugin anyway?

`protoc`, the **Proto**buf **c**ompiler, is used to generate code derived from Protobuf definitions (`.proto` files).
Under the hood, `protoc`'s job is to read and parse the definitions into their *Descriptor* types (see [google/protobuf/descriptor.proto](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/4f49062a95f18a6c7e21ba17715a2b0a4608151a/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto)).
When `protoc` is run (with a plugin) it creates a `CodeGeneratorRequest` (see [google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto#L68](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/4f49062a95f18a6c7e21ba17715a2b0a4608151a/src/google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto#L68)) that contains the descriptors for the files to generate and everything they import and passes it to the plugin via `stdin`.

A *protoc plugin* is an executable. It reads the `CodeGeneratorRequest` from `stdin` and returns a `CodeGeneratorResponse` (see [google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto#L99](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/4f49062a95f18a6c7e21ba17715a2b0a4608151a/src/google/protobuf/compiler/plugin.proto#L99)) via `stdout`.
The plugin can use the descriptors from the `CodeGeneratorRequest` to create output files (in memory).
It returns these output files (consisting of name and content as string) in the `CodeGeneratorResponse` to `protoc`.

`protoc` then writes these files to disk.

## Run `protoc` with your plugin

Assume you have an executable plugin under `path/to/plugin/main.py`.
You can invoke it via:

```
protoc 
    --plugin=protoc-gen-myplugin=path/to/plugin/main.py \
    --plugin_out=./output_root \
    myproto.proto myproto2.proto
```

Caveats:
- you must use the `--plugin=protoc-gen-<plugin_name>` prefix, otherwise `protoc` fails with "plugin not executable"
- your plugin must be executable (`chmod +x path/to/plugin/main.py` and put a `#!/usr/bin/env python` at the top of the file)
